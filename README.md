This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (FinalMLModel.ipynb) that implements a model for predicting maximum daily energy usage. To run the model, open `FinalMLModel.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment and execute all cells from the first cell to the last cell. Ensure that you have the `weather.csv` and `price_and_demand.csv` files in your working directory (please download them from this repository).

Upon running the last cell, the notebook will display the results of all models along with their corresponding accuracy.

After experimenting with different models, the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) model yielded the best results.
